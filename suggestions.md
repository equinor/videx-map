Suggestions and ideas for reference group:

1. Wellbore roots should not map to a single wellbore. They could instead highlight all wellbores it covers.
Highlight color for multi-select should be different than default (purple).
Reasoning: It is currently not intuitive which wellbore gets selected when hovering over the root.

2. When multiple wellbores are selected, clicking could bring up a radial menu. The options of this menu should be
the connected wellbores. An example have been given below.
